# VMS

The VMS application that allows staff to:

Check their colleagues contact details.
Check Rooms scheduled.

In this project i have used MVVM architectural pattern.

Testing is done for various models:
ApiManager
ViewModel

I have used Localization in this project.

The app reads two different API's for people and rooms information to display
In People,first the image and name is displayed for all the staff in collection view and on clicking it navigates into detail screen of employee.
In rooms, capacity and its occupancy status is displayed.

 Here are some screenshots of the output:
